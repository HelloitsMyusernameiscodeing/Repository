 <h1>Planets and their weights</h1>   
 <section><h1>Saturn</h1></section>
 <p>Saturn is one of the four gas giant planets, along with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.
Saturn is the English transliteration from the Latin word Saturnus, in Roman religion,
 the god of sowing or seed. The Romans equated him with the Greek 
 gricultural deity Kronos.It is estiamted that weight on staurn is 170th of the weight on earth</p>
 <section><h1>Jupiter</h1></section>
 <p>Wel the gravitational strength on Jupiter is 24.79 m/s^2 which means that if you were falling on Jupiter that's how fast you would accelerate. 
    This gravity is 2.52Ã— stronger than the 9.8 m/s^2 on earth 
    so if you multiply 50 by 2.52 you get 126.
    But weight isn't physically measured in kg, that's mass.
     But mass does not change no matter where you are so they would still have 50kg of
      mass but they would weigh more due to gravity. 50kg of mass on earth is equal to 
    500 Newton's if weight so they would weigh 1260 Newton's on Jupiter but still would have 50kg of mass.</p>\
    <section><h1>Uranus</h1></section>
    <p>Being that Uranus has a gravitational force of 8.69m/s 2, we multiply the object's mass by this quanitity 
        to calculate an object's weight on Uranus. So an object or person on Uranus would 
        weigh 88.6% its weight on earth. Therefore, a person would be lighter on Uranus.</p>
        <section><h1>Mars</h1></section>
        <p>Weight on Mars= (Weight on Earth/9.81m/s2) * 3.711m/s2. To find the Martian weight,
             we divide the weight on earth by the earth's force of gravity, which is 9.81m/s2. 
             This calculates the mass of the object. Once we have the object's mass, we can find the weight 
             by multiplying it by the gravitational force, which it is subject to. Being that Mars has a gravitational 
            force of 3.711m/s2, we multiply the object's mass by this quanitity to calculate an object's weight on mars.</p>
            <section><h1>Venus</h1></section>
            <p>Weight on Venus= (Weight on Earth/9.81m/s2) * 8.87m/s2. To find the weight on Venus, we divide the weight on earth by the earth's force of gravity, which is 9.81m/s2. This calculates the mass of the object. Once we have the object's mass, we can find the weight by multiplying it by the gravitational force, which it is subject to. Being that Venus has a gravitational force of 8.87m/s2,
                 we multiply the object's mass by this quanitity to calculate an object's weight on Venus.
                So an object or person on Venus would weigh 90.42% its weight on earth. Therefore, a person would be 
                lighter on Venus than on earth. Conversely, a person is 9.58% heavier on earth than on Venus.
            </p>
            <section><h1>Neptune</h1></section>
            <p>Weight on Neptune= (Weight on Earth/9.81m/s2) * 11.15m/s2. To find the weight on Neptune, we divide the weight on earth by the earth's force of gravity,
                 which is 9.81m/s2. This calculates the mass of the object. Once we have the object's mass, we can find the weight by multiplying it by the gravitational force, which it is subject to. Being that Neptune has a gravitational force of 11.15m/s2, we multiply the object's mass by this quanitity to calculate an object's weight on Neptune.
                So an object or person on Neptune would weigh 113.66% of its weight on earth. 
                Therefore, a person would be heavier on Neptune than on earth. Conversely, a person is 
                85.7% lighter on earth than on Neptune.</p>

             <section><h1>Earth</h1></section>
             <p>
                We calculate weight by multiplying mass by the gravity on the surface of the planet.
                Weight = Mass x Surface Gravity
                So, if you know your weight on Earth and the surface gravity on Earth, you can calculate your mass. 
                You can then calculate your weight on 
                any other planet by using the surface gravity of that planet in the same equation.</p>
